# IPL Data Analysis
#IPL Data Analysis and reporting pipeline developed an ETL pipeline to analyze IPL data from ball-by-
ball and match datasets stored in S3.
• Utilized AWS Glue to process and transform data according to requirement such as identifying most sixes,
fours, most wickets, and fastest centuries for each season.
• Automated the generation of season-wise analysis reports and stored the processed data in S3 with filenames
corresponding to the respective season years.
• Streamlined the data analysis process, enabling efficient and scalable insights into IPL performance metrics.
